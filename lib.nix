# nix/lib.nix — Shared helpers for nix stuff

# All JS packages in this repo are pnpm workspace members sharing a single

#
# buildPnpmPackage returns packageJsonPath (e.g. "ui-tui/package.json"),
# plus the shared pnpm store and node/pnpm toolchain.

  # source's JS-dir exclusions) is derived from this so the topology is
  # never duplicated.  Add a workspace to pnpm-workspace.yaml and the nix
  # build picks it up automatically.  Nix reads no YAML: this parses the
  # one shape the file uses (a top-level `packages:` key followed by
  # `  - <dir>` / `  - <dir>/*` lines) and throws on anything else, so a
  # reformatted list cannot silently drop a workspace.
